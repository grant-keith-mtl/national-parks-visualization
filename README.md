Grant's National Park Visualization
- This is an online interview problem that I encountered

Here is the problem:

"As we are a small company, we often have somewhat open-ended design problems. In that vein, we'd like you to take some JSON data about US National Parks and present it all on the page. This can be designed and implemented in any way you like — a table, a grid, or something else entirely — so long as you present all the data.

The JSON data about the National Parks are here.

Your submission here should include:

(1) A link to your source code, saved as a Pastebin snippet (note: please create an anonymous snippet free of personally identifiable information to allow us to do a blind review of your code sample)

(2) A short (2-3 paragraph) explanation explaining how your program works and why you made certain design choices

This should take between two and four hours. You're welcome to spend more time on it, but we certainly do not expect more effort than that."
